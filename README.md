## üöÄ Features

- **Conversational AI**: Chat with Perceptron using natural language. Trigger actions like playing music, searching on Google/Wikipedia, getting the time, or checking the weather.
  
- **Image Recognition**: Say "image" and provide a file path to get predictions on what the image contains.

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Perceptron analyzes the sentiment of the conversation, predicting emotions like happiness, sadness, and more.

- **Object Detection**: Detect and highlight objects in images with bounding boxes.

- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**: Extract and identify text from images.
